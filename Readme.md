# Final report

## Natural Language Processing and Psychology (Corpus Analysis)

The final assignment for this course is a 4-page paper in ACL format (download from [here](http://acl2017.org/calls/papers/)) covering one of the topics discussed this semester.

The topic can be either deep (a topic area such as deception or emotion) or broad (a specific feature or approach used in multiple areas).

The paper should cover an in-depth review of your selected topic, which should motivate a specific proposal for a contribution or advance over current practices. You do not have to implement this proposal, but it should be concrete and well-motivated.
